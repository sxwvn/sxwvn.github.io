It was a late Friday late, me and a buddy of mine just walked out of an event on the other side of the campus that had free food. That decision made sense when you're a broke and hungry college student. By the time we walked out it was already 12 A.M Saturday and you know what 12 A.M Saturday is like in a college town. Bunch of drunk people just pissing left and right. 

That was not the highlight of the night though. For a reason I can't disclose, later that night we went on an *adventure* that almost gone wrong. I will leave the journal at that and let you all guessing. Apart from that, the rest of my Saturday was boring and a little bit overwhelming because I need to do a lot of shit.
