I recently started to give my old playlist a listen again. I used to listen to a LOT of EDM tracks, and you will notice a clear inspiration if you listen to some of my earliest works. I turn out to be boring nowadays, I just listen to some good ol' indie rock/pop songs like everyone else lol. But hey, my 2019 playlist, it's so fucking good, wow. It's been a while but I still fuck with most of the songs! Sometimes EDM can be a bit repetitive after a few listens, but I think the variety of artists I used to listen to obscure that enough. 

Oh my, I miss some of these songs and really want to incorporate them in my own creation. Some artists I listened to a lot are ILLENIUM, MitiS, San Holo, Seven Lions, Jaron, Madeon, Dabin, Syence, you can see where the inspiration comes from? And in no particular order, here are some songs with styles that I kinda want to explore:
- Dream Dream Dream by Madeon
- lift me from the ground by San Holo remixed by Jaron
- Cinderella by JANEE (the drop is really good...)
- Always Afternoon by Medasin (Medasin's songs are a vibe tbh)
- Ego by Syence and Gazzo
- In Your Arms and Good Things Fall Apart by ILLENIUM (HOW DID I FORGET THESE BANGERS??)
