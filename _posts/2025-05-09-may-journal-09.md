Remind me to never drink coffee again because every time I did, it always made me jittery and sleepy. It's a weird combination! I thought if it gets me all jittery it should also energize me and shit, right? Nah, I just felt dizzy with an urge to crash out despite sleeping for 9 hours straight the night before. Essentially I got the anxiety bit WITHOUT the "making me hyperfocus on shit" bit. To be fair I think it depends on how strong the coffee is. I had a free latte drink from a campus event and that didn't do weird stuff on me. I bought the same latte today and it got me acting all weird. Maybe the free coffee wasn't as strong as the one I bought. I couldn't even finish it! I only drank a half cup.

People say that's a sign of ADHD. My ADHD friends also react to coffee the same way. Although I do suspect myself of being neurodivergent, I don't think it's ADHD. 

Why did I decide to drink coffee you may ask? I had an essay to work on. It's still due Monday but I have so many things to do for next week specifically and I need to get that essay out of the way before things get out of hand.
