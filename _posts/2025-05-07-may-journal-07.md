As I take a long look in the mirror \
Talking my heart out to an empty room \
I notice a few errors \
Of the horrors that loom

My mind is a machine \
That runs on rusty old gears \
Lamenting of what could've been \
Fueled by suspicion and fears

It's hard for me to forgive \
Though it's easy for me to forget \
Not of my mistakes, but of what I achieve \
And this is how I make myself, an enemy of my head

Acting rough on a kid doesn't make her tough \
And she's deserving of love by default \
As I fly high above the clouds \
I realized, I have made her very proud.
