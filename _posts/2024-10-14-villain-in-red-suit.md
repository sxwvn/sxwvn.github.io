The villain in red suit is a manifestation of my childhood trauma. I picture them wearing a bright red suit because of redacted reasons that will serve as a clue to OSINT my real identity. Let's just say, that's what they like to wear. Which is kind of unfortunate because I always thought my favorite color is red (I don't know what's my current favorite color anymore...).

I first wrote this song in February of 2021 when the wound was still fresh. I ocassionally listen to the song/watch the music video (especially when developing this website to make sure the video loads properly), and all I got from it was just sadness. In contrast, *Ambition, Competition, and Disappointment* resolves in a hopeful note. Well, I mean what do you expect when you quite literally traumatize a 16 year old kid? IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC as well...  

To quote one of my favorite artist of all time:
> Just 21 so I'm young and I'm stupid
>
> Only 16, yeah I think you should've known
>
> I think you fucked me up.
