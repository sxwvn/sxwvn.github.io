Don't you just love the feeling of thinking you got it all figured out, only to doubt it and start to consider other paths? What if *now* I really am not made for this? Do you think life is a series of "when there's a will there's a way"? Well, I start to doubt that saying a few years ago. I think there are things you are naturally inclined to do and maybe you should just stick with that, than to convince yourself you *can* achieve anything just because you *like* it.

Maybe I got jaded because I've only been getting 5 hours of sleep lately. That doesn't sound bad to many people but I'm not the type to stay up all night or wake up super early just to do something. It IS bad for me. Really bad. 

I guess I don't want to set anything in stone yet. I will try my best to achieve what I want, but if that turns out to be another detour, it's alright. Detours can be fun sometimes.
