I cried myself to sleep because the thought of coming back to an overwhelming life full of expectations was too much for me. I am not afraid of responsibilities and getting to a "serious age" or "serious phase of life" where I have to lock the fuck in and get an internship while graduating. I'm just afraid of not being able to breathe because I have to maintain a *perfect* life. 

For once in my life I feel alive this past 5 months. I can't reveal what happened to me that made that possible because again, that will serve as a clue to OSINT my real identity. Trust me, I never had this kind of work-life balance before. And I've been coming up with multiple guidelines and protocols so that I can "control" my life later, when this *phase* of my life ends. Sadly it will come to an end in a few days. 

Hey, it's just life, right? Things start and things end. Changes can be scary, life is inherently chaotic, and I will eventually be alright.
