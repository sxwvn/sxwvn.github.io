<p>Paradoxically I think the most faithful, loyal, and trustworthy person asks the most questions. I think the person you should trust in a crisis should be someone who’s most doubtful. A personal rule of thumb is if someone seems to be so optimistic and believing of a product or solution, run. I think an ethical expert knows better that their solution is not perfect. The more confident you are with something, the more doubtful I am with it. This isn’t something new that everyone just realized, I just happen to give it a proper thought today.</p>

<p>Trust is a big scary word. In a paranoid sense, who do you trust with your personal data online when your behavior has been commodified and used by a few rich oligarchs to control the narrative of the world? In a personal sense, what happens if you let your walls down and be vulnerable; be naked and be awkward?</p>

<p>99% of the time, the answer to the personal sense of trust is nothing. 50% maybe it’ll make you happier and more fulfilled. But in a crisis, what if, what if the remaining 1% happens? What kind of mitigation steps do you have? What is your threat model? What are you willing to lose? To what extent are you willing to risk it all, for security? For a sense of stability?</p>

<p>Even if it’s a lost cause, will you stay with the sinking ship? Will you steer the wheel of a one-way relationship? Will you change your name, will you cover your face, will you cut your hair and will you move in order to keep the ship afloat? Is this faith? Is this loyalty? Is this based on trust? Or are you naive, dear? Do you let people run you over, do what is expected of you, denying yourself?</p>

<p>This is why my friends think I’m insane.</p>
