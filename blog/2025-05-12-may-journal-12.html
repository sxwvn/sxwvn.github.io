In this software simulation, we use Pygame software-based simulation. The figure above shows the simulation results for one vehicle passing in one lane. There are two sensors that can calculate the speed of the vehicle and if the vehicle does not exceed the speed limit, which is 30 km/h then the Smart Speed Bump is not active and the camera also does not take pictures of the vehicle (Figure \ref{fig:one-slow}). However, if the vehicle is detected to be exceeding the speed limit by both sensors, the Smart Speed Bump is active and the camera also takes a picture of the vehicle illustrated by a red color change on the camera (Figure \ref{fig:one-fast}). Each simulation will record vehicle's speed on the speed graph.
