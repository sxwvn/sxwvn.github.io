<p>I do not want to talk about this day. I’m physically stuck and I’m mentally somewhere else. If there’s a silver lining at least I don’t die yet.</p>

<p>Hey, can we please stop looking at things as if they have a hidden lesson?</p>

<p><em>“Oh, you’re such a brave and stong kid for doing that! This surely taught you how to be an independent adult and you sure did go through it well!”</em></p>

<p>No. Can I just be pissed about this? None of these were not my fault. It didn’t teach me shit.</p>
