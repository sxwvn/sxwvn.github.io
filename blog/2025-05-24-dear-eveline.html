<p>It has been a year since the Dear Eveline challenge ends. That was a fun one. My third canonical album basically served as an exercise to compose one song each month for a year. I ended up having 13 songs with various styles and varying degree of effort put on the respected “music videos”, depending on how busy I was.</p>

<p>If I have to pick a favorite (in this particular order), here are my proudest works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Christmas Eve: It was supposed to be titled something else but for OSINT mitigation reasons (my top reason of not disclosing information) I quickly changed the title. It’s nice that I got to upload that when it actually was Christmas Eve. This song reminds me a lot of late night Christmas joy, where the weather is just perfect; not too cold so it’s still warm enough outside. You’d go and explore the festive city at night, passing along strangers on the street. I have a soft spot for after night sceneries, the calmness and emptiness of places late at night. That’s what it reminds me of. Less of the cultural/religious background of Christmas Eve, but more of that <em>after hours</em> feeling I get on that time of the year.</li>
  <li>End Credits (Outro): Surprisingly the bonus track gets a second place on my favorite list. This song could’ve been more though, especially on the visual side. I was learning about Computer Graphics, especially how computers render 3D scenes using maths, or commonly abstracted using Blender. In fact, the cover art was made using Blender! I did not have enough time and energy to learn 3D animation from 0 and upload a 3D music video. This is wild to say because I have the exact same plan few months ago for a song planned to be released on the next Friday the 13th (which is June 13th this year). I haven’t made any significant progress towards that music vidoe :D!!</li>
  <li>Impermanence: Perfect title, good album opener, and a completely different style that for some reasons work well for my taste. Impermanence as a word is also the lesson that keeps ringing in my head the past few years. Could’ve been mixed better though, that’s why it’s on the 3rd place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Honorable mention would go to <em>One In A Million</em> for the classic reason that I <em>could’ve done better.</em> The song was suppose to be released in November 2023 but I made the last minute decision to partner up with my friend instead for the cover art. It took her a while to finish, but that gave the perfect opportunity for me to release the song in February 2024. Just know that the month is special for me and the person I made <em>One In A Million</em> for.</p>

<p>My thought process on the composition of that song was to basically try to emulate <em>A House In Nebraska</em> by <em>Ethel Cain</em>. Why? because that song was stuck in my head. If you can’t figure it out, it’s the part my song where a guitar lead suddenly appears over a slow beating drum in the background. Huge emphasis on trying to emulate there. If you don’t know it yet, I use <a href="https://lmms.io">LMMS</a> as my DAW since it’s the only FOSS (and intuitive enough to use) DAW that could run on Linux. Yes, I use Linux, entry 2 and 19 should make it clear that I’m a paranoid freak but anyway. LMMS, DAW, not really ideal for recording emotional, slow burn, songs. Most of the default synths are 8-bit, chiptune-y, game soundtrack synths. I did not own a proper recording equipment when I made that song. So it is what it is, but hey, I’m still proud of it.</p>
