<h2 id="under-construction">UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!</h2>

<p>When the album does come, and in an unlikely event of it blowing up, the OG’s will remember that this song has long been published before the <em>official</em> release date!</p>

<p>If everything we ever had has come to and end, well I hope it ends in a good note.
If this chapter of our lives has come to a close, well I don’t know, I wish I didn’t have to go</p>

<p>Cause I don’t want to be hurt
Yet I never learn
To put up a fight
And set my boundary right</p>

<p>Everything we ever called our home has always been a mess
So I bid my farewell and God bless.</p>
