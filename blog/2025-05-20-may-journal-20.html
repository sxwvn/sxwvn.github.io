<p>If you could associate a song with the impermanence of human relationship, what would it be?</p>

<p>My personal answer is This Is Not Enough by Hammock.</p>

<p>I think I mentioned that song before. It’s in B major, 3/4 time signature, the chord progression is pretty simple. It’s your usual I - IV - vi - V but they way it’s arranged makes it very beautiful and special to me. The instrumental break near the end is just top notch. I’m always lost having this scenario in my head where flashes of memories spent with my loved ones just play like a movie reel, as if I’m going to fucking die lmao.</p>

<p>Hey, good song. I recommend it.</p>
