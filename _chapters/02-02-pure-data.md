You are my dear friend, The Chicken Lady. You wear a thick black coat with a purple cape and a pair of yellow gloves, since you are living up above where the snow falls. You are a farmer and it has always been like that. You inherited vast farmlands from your mother which she inherited from her mother, and her mother and so on. I have a special task for you.

Get your shovel, make a hole deep enough to bury a body. 

```bash
$ mkdir hole

Now I'm going to transfer a few amounts of things that I trust you will take good care of. Because unlike me, you are *strong.*You will not let the toughest winter bring you down. You are *brave*. You're not afraid to deal with the beasts from your nightmares head on. You are as *solid* as the rocks on where your family's cabin was built and remained for generations to generations. 

*You are everything I ever wanted to become.*

```bash
$ ls ~/Documents/Vault/'Unfortunate Events'
'Act I Chapter II: The Guest House (detailed).docx'    
expectations.txt   
on-the-matter-of-impermanence.txt
'memory clips (before the divorce).mp4'   
vulnerabilities.txt          
'what my extended family think of me.mp3'

```

```bash
$ sudo mv -f /home/fidel/Documents/Vault/'Unfortunate Events' /home/chicken/hole
```

With that setup, I have enough space for things that are more relevant and more useful. For deadline reminders from the project manager I work with. For instructions on how to pay the electricity bills. For the data pipeline of my passion project. For my passwords, recovery keys, and other identities. I may still be breathing oxygen and my body is still made out of carbon. But my mind, my mind is a machine, that turns command into real-life actions.

Now that, is how you become reliable and trustworthy. Just like what is expected of me.
