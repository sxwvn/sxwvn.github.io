SXWVN is an indie songwriter from Indonesia. Her musical style is heavily inspired by video game music. She started composing music when she was 15 and that became her coping mechanism just a year later, after what she refers to as **"a series of unfortunate events"** changed the trajectory of her life. Apart from making music and animation in her free time, she also codes websites like this and analyzes traces of malware. 

"There is absolutely nothing shady about this website at all. I might've *accidentally* installed a **brain malware**, but you can trust me on this one."
