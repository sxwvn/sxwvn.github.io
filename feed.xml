Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The villain in red suit is a manifestation of my childhood trauma. I picture them wearing a bright red suit because of redacted reasons that will serve as a clue to OSINT my real identity. Let’s just say, that’s what they like to wear. Which is kind of unfortunate because I always thought my favorite color is red (I don’t know what’s my current favorite color anymore…).</p>

<p>I first wrote this song in February of 2021 when the wound was still fresh. I ocassionally listen to the song/watch the music video (especially when developing this website to make sure the video loads properly), and all I got from it was just sadness. In contrast, <em>Ambition, Competition, and Disappointment</em> resolves in a hopeful note. Well, I mean what do you expect when you quite literally traumatize a 16 year old kid? IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC as well…</p>

<p>To quote one of my favorite artist of all time:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just 21 so I’m young and I’m stupid</p>

  <p>Only 16, yeah I think you should’ve known</p>

  <p>I think you fucked me up.</p>
